# HDF5 python tutorial

This project is a playground for learning HDF5 file format.


You will see how to create datsets, groups and attributes.
There are also some information about reading data from hdf5 files via numpy like
interface.

* **h5py_introducion.py** - basic operation on hdf5 file, writing to file, creating datasets, 
groups and metadata.
* **big_file.py** - contains script which shows how to write to huge files in chunks.
It uses dataset.resize to change the file size.
